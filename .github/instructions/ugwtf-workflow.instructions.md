## Label System

### How to Label Issues

**Priority** (pick one):
- `priority:p0` — Critical, blocking launch
- `priority:p1` — High, needed before launch
- `priority:p2` — Medium, nice to have
- `priority:p3` — Low, future enhancement

**Automation tier** (pick one):
- `automation:copilot` — Copilot can implement autonomously
- `automation:full` — Fully automated workflow
- `automation:partial` — Agent assists, human decides
- `automation:manual` — Must be done manually

**Status** (applied automatically by agents):
- `automation:in-progress` — Pipeline running
- `automation:completed` — Done successfully
- `agent:copilot` — Assigned to Copilot
- `needs-pr` — Issue needs a pull request
- `stalled` — No activity >48h
- `needs-review` — Awaiting human review

### Creating Issues for Copilot

To have Copilot auto-pick up an issue:

1. Create the issue with labels: `agent:copilot` + `automation:copilot` + `priority:pN`
2. Run: `npx tsx src/index.ts issues ugwtf`
3. The `issue-copilot-assign` agent will assign Copilot and mark `automation:in-progress`

## PR Workflow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Copilot opens PR | Validate with `prs ugwtf` |
| PR is draft | Promote with `prs ugwtf` |
| Tests pass | Merge via GitHub UI (squash merge) |
| Merge | Issues linked via `Closes #N` are auto-closed |

**DB Firewall**: PRs touching migration files require manual approval before merge.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Don't assign Copilot manually via GitHub UI — use `npx tsx src/index.ts issues ugwtf`
- ❌ Don't merge PRs that fail the UGWTF validate gate
- ❌ Don't create issues and immediately close them in the same session
- ✅ Always run `validate ugwtf` before marking work complete
